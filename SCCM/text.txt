Key Additions:
Remediation-Even-Servers (Day +15): A dedicated group for addressing any issues found in even-numbered servers after the initial patching phase. This provides a specific window to perform necessary fixes without impacting the broader environment.

Remediation-Odd-Servers (Day +16): Similar to the even servers' remediation group, this is focused on odd-numbered servers, ensuring any post-patch issues can be swiftly and efficiently resolved.

Notes:
The remediation groups are scheduled after the completion of the critical application updates, allowing for a full review of the patching impact across all servers before starting remediation efforts.

Manual Patching Available for Download-Only-DB-Servers: This remains unchanged, emphasizing the flexibility for database administrators to apply patches manually, based on their assessment and schedule.

This updated schedule integrates remediation efforts into the patching strategy, providing a structured approach to not only apply updates but also to address any resultant issues in a timely and organized manner.
